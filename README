Intro

Soma project started in summer 2003 to manage the digital version of an 
acitvists radio old spools.
The first  release just  gave just the chance to play random some audio files
in a directory using an external program (at that time mpg123). In despite 
of that this software was never used, i kept on thinking about soma project 
for some weeks, until i started directly to work with a group called Reload,
which was experimenting at the time a project called "eterete" and creating 
a place for a web radio at Pergola Tribe (a selfmanaged house in Milan).

We used, of course, a release, which was a little bit better to manage the 
radio-playlist and of course we implemented the software itself. From 
september till december soma became a software suite, configurable through 
file and  (remote administration...). That's thanks to the relationships and 
the inputs that such a community like Reload can create :)

A group of passionate activists was able to make broadcastings and broadcast 
schedules, to find out new problems and to give implementation advices. They 
also suggest me the idea that soma (originally a simple play-list manager) 
could become a programs suite, which has a player, a software for deferred 
broadcasting, a more user friendly admininstration, documentation and 
distribution.

Some time after came soma player and soma admin. The player was still very 
behind compared to my implementation ideas. Somadmin was straight away on 
line and advertised on radio.inventati.org/somadmin/

In January 2004 we showed Soma at the first italian (web and air-waves) radio 
meeting in Naples.The meeting was technologically and politically profitable 
and it was an attempt to build up a real radio-network.
Radio.inventati.org was actually the only example od direct cooperation among 
even very different people: individuals, improvised groups, very old and 
movement radios and experiences from overseas countries.

On the web site there are occasional streamings, weekly streamings, and 24hrs 
music flows.

The object of the technical research was a digital environment, which could let
individuals or whole communities gain access to a common schedule with resum?s,
repetitions, deferred programs, live broadcastings, regular broadcastings as 
one national and international network.
Soma could satisfy this need and could be easly managed through the web thanks 
to somadmin, which could update the soma  admin  in real time.

The developments went on. Somaplayer  is now reality. The only music player 
which can stream directly an mp3, an ogg vorbis, a wav, a track from an audio 
cd or a streaming directly on an icecast server (icecast 2 or shoutcast) or 
just play it on a computer using sound drivers or sound daemons.

At the moment more other people work at this project, who debug the software, 
write docs, work at the website and make installation packages (for debian).

Good hacking.
